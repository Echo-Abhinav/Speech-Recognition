# Speech-Recognition
Speech recognition is the process of converting an acoustic signal, captured bya microphone or any peripherals to a set of words.

This project uses the Libre-Speech Dataset for training and the average word error is around 0.364.
We cab futher reduce this by using more datasets for training.
